# Local symmetry representation in the brain

This study will apply computational models to examine where and how local symmetry such as parallelism and mirror symmetry are computed in our brain. 
By analyzing brain activity data, I aim to localize where in the images produce symmetry signals in the brain and which parts of the brain are associated with these signals.
